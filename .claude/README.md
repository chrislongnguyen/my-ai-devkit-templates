# Claude adapter

This folder contains the Claude-specific adapter for the LTC 2-State Execution Engine.

- Canonical Claude adapter file: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Engine entry point: `engine/SKILL.md`

If your Claude environment only auto-loads root `CLAUDE.md`, keep the root file as a thin pointer to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
