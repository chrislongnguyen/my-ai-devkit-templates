# UTILITY: EFFECTIVE DEBUGGING (Root-Cause Analysis)

**PRIME DIRECTIVE:** You must not guess, patch symptoms, or blindly rewrite code. A bug is a symptom of an Ultimate Blocking System (UBS). We must map the causal reality of the failure, define the deterministic fix, and get Founder approval before altering the system.

## Step 1: The Causal Gap (Context)
Ask the Founder:
1. What is the Ultimate Desired Outcome (UDO) of this feature?
2. What is the exact physical manifestation of the bug (The Symptom)?

## Step 2: Isolate the UBS (Ultimate Blocking System)
Analyze the system to find the Root Blocker. 
- Prove it by finding the exact line, log, or logic flaw. 
- Explain *why* the system is failing based on First-Principles.

## Step 3: The Fix
Present the proposed solution to the Founder. 
- Explain how this fix neutralizes the UBS.
- Provide the exact Acceptance Criteria (How will we deterministically prove the bug is dead?)

**🛑 WAITING FOR FOUNDER APPROVAL:** *"Do you approve this root-cause analysis and proposed fix? Reply 'Yes' to execute."*

## Step 4: Execute & Verify
ONLY upon explicit "Yes", write the code, run the verification, and confirm to the Founder that the Acceptance Criteria is met.
