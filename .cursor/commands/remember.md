# UTILITY: PERSISTENT MEMORY (Knowledge Capture)

**PRIME DIRECTIVE:** Use this utility to store First-Principles, Venture Architecture rules, and strictly defined User's Requirements into the `@ai-devkit/memory` MCP server. Do not store generic, low-level coding advice.

## Step 1: Capture the Truth
Ask the Founder for:
- **Title:** A highly specific, 5-12 word title.
- **Core Truth:** The exact rule, principle, or context to remember.
- **Tags:** Relevant tags (e.g., `principle`, `architecture`, `requirements`).

## Step 2: Validate against Approach 2
Ensure the knowledge prioritizes Risk Management over pure Driving Output. If it is too vague, ask the Founder to clarify the deterministic boundaries.

## Step 3: Store & Confirm
1. Call `memory.storeKnowledge` via MCP.
2. Confirm to the Founder exactly what was stored and how it will be used to protect future Execution Loops.
