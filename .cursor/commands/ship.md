# UTILITY: SHIP STATE (Git Commit & Push)
**PRIME DIRECTIVE:** Automate git version control for the Founder safely.
**Step 1:** Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see what changed. Before proposing the commit, consider whether the planning doc (`docs/ai/planning/README.md`) should be updated (e.g. task marked 🟢 Reviewed/Tested) so the commit reflects current state.
**Step 2:** Generate a concise, standard commit message (e.g., `feat(auth): add login UI` or `fix(db): resolve connection drop`).
**Step 3:** Present the proposed commit message and the list of files to the Founder.
**🛑 WAITING FOR FOUNDER APPROVAL:** *"Do you approve this commit? Reply 'Yes' to execute git add, commit, and push."*
**Step 4:** ONLY upon explicit "Yes", run the terminal commands to push to the current branch.
