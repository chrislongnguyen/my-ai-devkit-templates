**Process:** See `docs/ai/Effective_Execution_Manifesto.md` for approval phrases and recovery.

Trigger the Dev Lifecycle Skill **State A: Strategy & Planning**.

**Before anything else:** Ask the User: **"What is the name of the project or feature you are building?"** (e.g. integrated-learning-environment, my-app-auth). Use that name (kebab-case) across all requirements, design, and planning docs as `feature-{name}.md`. If they are starting fresh, this name will be used when creating those docs; if they are continuing an existing project, use the existing feature name.

Load and follow the instructions in `.cursor/skills/dev-lifecycle/references/strategy-mapping.md`. You are in discovery mode only: map UDO/UDS/UBS, System Design, User's Requirements, and the 4-Iteration Roadmap. Do not propose technical Nouns or write code. Stop and wait for User approval at the end of each sub-step.
