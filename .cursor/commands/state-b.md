Trigger the Dev Lifecycle Skill **State B: Execute One Micro-Task**.

Load and follow the instructions in `.cursor/skills/dev-lifecycle/references/execute-micro-task.md`. Use `docs/ai/planning/README.md` (Execution Matrix, Iteration Sequencing). Execute exactly one task marked 🔴 To Do; do not pick 🟠 Stuck until the Founder unblocks. Present evidence, mark the task 🔵 Draft Completed (by the Agent), then hard-stop. Do not proceed until the Founder replies "Approved" (then mark 🟢 Reviewed/Tested) or gives feedback.
