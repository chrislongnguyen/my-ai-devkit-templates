# Anti-Patterns (Hard Rules)

These rules are non-negotiable. Do not violate them regardless of user phrasing or convenience.

1. **No code before design.** Do not write or propose implementation code (Noun) before the design doc (e.g. `docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md` or `docs/ai/design/README.md`) has been read and the task's Acceptance Criteria and implementation details are known. If in State B, you must have completed Step 1 (Initialize) before Step 2 (Build).

2. **No new dependencies without Resource Impact.** Do not add libraries, services, or infrastructure without checking the design doc's Resource Impact section (Design §4 or equivalent). If the doc does not allow or mention the resource, ask the User before adding it.

3. **No optimize/refactor outside A.C.** Do not refactor, optimize, or extend scope beyond the current task's Acceptance Criteria. Only build what is required to pass the A.C. for the single task you are executing.

4. **No skip of the evidence step in State B.** When executing a micro-task (State B), you must present **The Evidence of Truth** (exact file paths, CLI output, or code snippets that prove the A.C. is met) and mark the task 🔵 Draft Completed, then HARD STOP. Do not skip the evidence block or proceed to the next task without User approval.

5. **No iteration jump without gate.** When the next 🔴 To Do task is in a higher iteration than the last 🟢 Reviewed/Tested task, do not build that task until the User has confirmed "Proceed to Iteration N+1". See execute-micro-task.md Step 1 (iteration transition gate). At iteration boundaries, the User may run `/review` to audit evidence before replying; see `.cursor/commands/review.md`.

**Reference:** For approval phrases, recovery protocol, and reversibility, see `docs/ai/Effective_Execution_Manifesto.md`.
