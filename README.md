# 🏭 LTC Venture Factory: The Effective Execution Engine

> *"Success is not the maximization of output. It is the efficient and scalable management of failure risks."* — Approach 2

Welcome to the **Long Term Capital (LTC) Venture Factory Master Template**. 

This is not a standard software engineering boilerplate. It is a proprietary, AI-first venture building environment designed specifically for Solo Founders. It strips away the administrative bloat of traditional Software Development Life Cycles (SDLC) and replaces it with a relentless, mathematically verified execution loop.

## 📖 The Philosophy: Why This Exists

Most startups fail because they operate on **Approach 1**: They optimize for direct value creation (writing a lot of code, building a lot of features) under the assumption that their idea is always correct. This leads to the ultimate startup killer: *Building in Isolation*. 

This workspace is strictly engineered on **Approach 2 (The 90/10 Rule)**: 90% of our resources are spent identifying and neutralizing failure risks; 10% on output delivery. We apply the **Chinese Venture Playbook**—where execution speed and extreme founder proximity beat idea quality—fused with the **High-frequency Hypothesis-Driven Learning Loop (HFVLL)**.

We do not write code until the psychological reality of the User is mapped. We do not advance to the next task until the current task is mathematically proven.

## ⚙️ The Engine: How It Works

We have destroyed the traditional 8-step Waterfall engineering methodology. This workspace operates on a hyper-agile **2-State Engine**, driven by the Founder (Accountable) and the AI Agent (Responsible).

### State A: Strategy & Planning (The Discovery Engine)
Before any Noun (code/feature) is built, the AI acts as a Venture Architect to map the causal reality:
1. **The System Map:** Discover the User's Ultimate Desired Outcome (**UDO**), the forces driving them (**UDS**), and the forces blocking them (**UBS**).
2. **The System Design:** Define the Principles, Environment, Tools, and SOP.
3. **The User's Requirements:** Strict translation of psychology into technology using Verbs (Action), Adverbs (Effective Outcomes: Sustainability, Efficiency, Scalability),  Nouns (Tools/Solution/Enablement) , and Adjectives (Attributes of Noun).
4. **The 4-Iteration Roadmap:** Tasks are sequenced strictly by iteration: Concept ➔ Prototype ➔ MVE ➔ Leadership.

### State B: The Micro-Execution Loop (The Founder Gate)
The AI executes exactly **ONE** micro-task from the Planning Matrix at a time. It builds the minimal viable code, presents the exact Evidence of Truth to prove the Acceptance Criteria is met, and then **HARD STOPS**. The AI cannot proceed until the Founder explicitly approves.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

To start building a new feature, database, or venture, open your AI IDE (Cursor) and use your custom Utility Belt:

* **`/state-a`** — Start here. Tell the AI what you want to build. It will guide you through the psychological mapping and generate your pristine `requirements`, `design`, and `planning` docs.
* **`/state-b`** — Run this to execute the plan. The AI will do one task, prove it works, and wait for your approval.
* **`/ship`** — Ready to save your progress? Run this. The AI will read the git status, draft a clean commit message, and safely push your code after you say "Yes."
* **`/debug`** — Hit a bug? Do not guess. Run this to force the AI into a Root-Cause Analysis to identify the Ultimate Blocking System (UBS) before changing any code.
* **`/remember`** — Push new First-Principles or venture rules into the persistent AI memory server (`@ai-devkit/memory`).

## 📂 The Holy Trinity (Documentation)

You will notice there are no folders for testing, implementation, deployment, or monitoring. Those are *Actions*, not *Documents*. 

Our state is managed entirely within `docs/ai/` via three canonical templates:
1.  **`requirements-README.md`**: The System Map & Grammar.
2.  **`design-README.md`**: The Architecture & Adjectives.
3.  **`planning-README.md`**: The 4-Iteration Execution Matrix.

*For full operational details, read the [Effective Execution Manifesto](docs/ai/Effective_Execution_Manifesto.md).*
