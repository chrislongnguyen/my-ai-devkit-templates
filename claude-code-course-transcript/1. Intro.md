Welcome to Claude Code, the Highly Agentic Coding Assistant.
0:05
This short course is built in partnership with Anthropic
0:08
and Anthropic's Elie Schoppik is back to share with us
0:11
best practices for how to use Claude Code.
0:13
I'm really excited about this short course.
0:15
Claude Code's my personal favorite coding assistant right now,
0:18
and it has boosted my and many other developers' productivity
0:22
by a large margin. And it is a
0:24
tool with a lot of depth to it.
0:27
And so I want to get together with Anthropic,
0:29
to teach, hopefully the definitive course on
0:32
all of the most important ideas behind
0:35
how to use it in a systematic way.
0:37
Thanks, Andrew. I'm excited to be back
0:39
here and start like you mentioned from explaining
0:41
what the tool is, how it works,
0:43
all the way towards using it in parallel
0:45
with many different tools including Git worktrees and MCP servers.
0:50
What we've seen over the last couple
0:52
years is AI assisted coding has evolved rapidly.
0:54
It started from maybe people asking LLMs occasional coding questions.
0:58
suggestions to then GitHub autocomplete to then,
1:01
your various tools that became
1:03
more and more autonomous.
1:05
And Claude Code, when it was released,
1:08
was definitely a step up in terms of the degree of agency
1:10
or the amount of stuff that the coding assistant
1:13
could do by itself. And so
1:15
I think many people were surprised that
1:17
you could set a task that Claude would work on for
1:20
many minutes or sometimes even more than a few minutes.
1:23
And now there are developers that are orchestrating
1:25
not just a single Claude instance, but even several of them.
1:28
working in parallel on different parts
1:30
of a codebase. But coordinating all this
1:32
has to set the best practices that is not widely known
1:36
and if you have not worked
1:37
with people close to the best practices,
1:39
I think there could be a big uplift
1:41
still for mastering these best practices
1:45
and knowing how they drive that amazing productivity
1:47
that I'm seeing many developers have using Claude Code.
1:50
So as we start to talk about those best practices,
1:53
a key tip for working with Claude Code is providing clear context
1:57
to help Claude code achieve the task you want efficiently.
2:00
This means pointing Claude code to the relevant files,
2:03
clearly describing the features and functionality that you want
2:06
and making sure that you're properly extending
2:09
the capabilities of Claude code
2:11
with MCP servers and other tools in that ecosystem.
2:14
In this course, you'll apply those best practices to three different examples.
2:18
We'll start with a RAG chatbot
2:19
and you'll implement the features from
2:21
the front end to the back end,
2:22
including refactoring code, writing tests,
2:26
and then using the GitHub integration to
2:28
work with pull requests and fixing issues.
2:30
You'll make use of many Claude Code features
2:32
like planning, thinking modes, creating parallel sessions,
2:35
and managing Claude's memory.
2:37
For the second example, we'll shift gears and work with Jupyter notebooks
2:40
to explore e-commerce data.
2:42
We'll refactor notebooks using Claude Code, remove redundant code,
2:46
and create powerful dashboards with web applications.
2:49
Finally, we'll move to create a visual mockup
2:51
based in Figma and use Claude Code,
2:54
the Figma MCP server and a different
2:56
MCP server to import the design,
2:59
iterate, test, and build agentically a powerful front-end application.
3:03
If you're not currently a Claude Code user,
3:05
I think learning this set of
3:08
ideas will give you a meaningful acceleration
3:10
in the way that which you can engineer systems.
3:13
And even if you are a current Claude Code user,
3:15
I think having Ellie share these best practices
3:18
with you in a comprehensive and systematic way,
3:21
will, I hope, leave you with quite a few new things
3:24
you try that will be useful. your work.
3:27
I'd like to thank from DeepLearning.AI, Hawraa Salami,
3:29
who had contributed to this course.
3:32
In the next video, Elie will share
3:35
Claude Code's underlying architecture,
3:37
and you might be surprised by how simple the architecture is.
3:41
Claude Code relies on just a small number of tools to search
3:44
for patterns within your code files,
3:46
to list directories, look at files, do regex.
3:50
It does not rely on semantically embedding
3:52
your code in the code base or transforming it into
3:55
searchable structure. And one of the things that
3:58
I think has made Claude Code effective
3:59
is how it agentically can read through your code
4:03
to take notes in a file called code.md to figure out autonomously
4:08
what is going on your codebase to then
4:10
drive decision-making on how to advance your code.
4:13
That's right. And because of that, and not
4:15
having a need to index the codebase,
4:16
you can ensure the codebase stays local.
4:19
We'll talk about some of the security ramifications with that.
4:22
So let's get started. And I'll see you in the next video.
