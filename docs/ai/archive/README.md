# Archive (read-only historical record)

**Do not edit.** This folder is a historical record only.

## Archived Features

| Feature | Archived Date | Contents | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

*System Wiki remains active at `docs/ai/wiki/system-engine-hardening.md` as the definitive operational record.*

*Previous archive content (legacy feature docs, ai-devkit integration, handoff snapshots) was removed during engine-hardening (T-102). The active docs live in `docs/ai/requirements/`, `docs/ai/design/`, `docs/ai/planning/`, `docs/ai/frameworks/`, `docs/ai/examples/`, and `docs/ai/wiki/`.*

## Why Archive?

Completed features are moved here to keep the active tree clean while preserving the full engineering history. The System Wiki (if present) remains in `docs/ai/wiki/` as the definitive operational record for each feature.
