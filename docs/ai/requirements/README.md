# 1. EFFECTIVE REQUIREMENTS (User Actions)

## 1.1 The Problem Space
**What problem are we solving?**
- **Core Pain Point:** [Describe the core problem]
- **Current Workaround:** [How do they solve it now?]

## 1.2 The Actor
- **User(s):** [Who is the human or system actor?]

## 1.3 Desired User Action (The Goal)
* **Verb (The Core Action):** [What do they do?]
    * *Acceptance Criteria 1:* [Pass/Fail check]
    * *Acceptance Criteria 2:* [Pass/Fail check]

### Effectiveness Constraints (The "How")
* **Sustainability Adverbs (Safety/Risk):** [How do they do it safely?]
    * *Constraint/Adverb:* [e.g., "Securely", "Correctly", "Consistently", "Reliably"]
    * *Acceptance Criteria:* [e.g., "Output is consistent everytime",  "No API keys exposed", "99% data accuracy"]

* **Efficiency Adverbs (Utility/Speed):** [How do they do it well?]
    * *Adverb:* [e.g., "Quickly", "Cheaply"]
    * *Acceptance Criteria:* [e.g., "Response under 2s", "Must not exceed $0.50 per run"]

* **Scalability Adverbs (Growth):** [How do they do it repeatedly?]
    * *Adverb:* [e.g., "Repeatedly", "Globally"]
    * *Acceptance Criteria:* [e.g., "Can run 100 times without IP blocking"]

## 1.4 Non-Goals
- **Out of Scope:** [What are we explicitly NOT doing?]
